# React + TypeScript + Vite Boilerplate

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. This boilerplate is designed for static page projects â€” ideal for applications that do not require a backend service. It focuses on fast UI development and rapid prototyping. Built with React and a pre-configured set of tools, it provides a solid foundation for creating clean, maintainable, and responsive user interfaces with minimal setup. Here are some of the useful traits that this boilerplate provides

## âœ¨ Features

### Light UI Components
This boilerplate uses [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs) as the core UI library. On top of that, Iâ€™ve enhanced several components with subtle microinteractions to bring a more delightful and responsive user experience.

### Fast App Building
This boilerplate is powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), ensuring lightning-fast builds and an ultra-smooth development experience with features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Beyond the speed, Vite also offers powerful production optimizations out of the boxâ€”such as code splitting, source maps, and moreâ€”all of which are pre-configured to help your static site perform at its best.

### SEO Friendly
This boilerplate comes pre-configured with SEO-friendly metadata settings. All you need to do is customize the valuesâ€”no extra setup required. Itâ€™s ready to help your static site rank better and get discovered more easily on search engines.

### Domain Drive Design
The codebase follows a domain-driven structure, making it intuitive to scale and maintain. Logic and components are grouped by feature, not by typeâ€”encouraging clean separation of concerns and easier collaboration between developers.

```css
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CustomDomain/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts

|       â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â””â”€â”€ utils/
```

### Seamless Light & Dark Mode
A fully functional light/dark theme toggle is built-in and integrated using Tailwind's dark mode class strategy. The theme state persists across sessions and automatically adapts to system preferencesâ€”so your users enjoy the best experience day or night.
